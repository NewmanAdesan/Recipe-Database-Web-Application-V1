STEP 1: THE HEADER LAYOUT
STEP 2: THE HEADER COMPONENT STYLING
STEP 3: THE HEADER COMPONENT INTERACTION (PAGE THEME LOGIC)



STEP 1: THE HEADER LAYOUT

    The Header   
    the header container is a flex-box that constitute 4 items
        - the Logo
        - the Navigation links
        - the Theme Switch button
        - the Saved Recipe button

    The Logo
        - the logo container is a link to the homepage (href='/')
        - the logo container encapsulate two images. both are the same logo but with different colors
        - when the website is in light-theme mode, only one logo image displays (the light-theme-logo)
        - when the website is in dark-theme mode, only one logo image displays (the dark-theme-logo)
        - the logo images have a width of 156 pixel & a height of 32 pixel

    The Navigation links
        - the navigation link container is hidden for mobile view.
        - there are two links in the navigation container "Home" & "Recipes".
        - the links font-size category is "title-small".
        - the link that is active has a special style; an orange underline.
        - when the UNACTIVE LINK is hovered upon, its background color transition to a color called 'alpha-10'.

    The Theme Switch Button
        - the button container encapsulate two material icon.
        - when the website is in light-theme mode, only one material icon displays (the light-theme-icon).
        - when the website is in dark-theme mode, only one material icon displays (the dark-theme-icon).
        - when the button is hovered on, its background color transition to a color called 'alpha-10'.
        - the theme switch button is a style component called "icon-button".
        - the material icons have an aria-hidden of true
        - the button container have an aria-pressed of false
        - the button container have an aria-lable of 'Toggle Light & dark Theme'

    The Saved Recipe button
        - the container is a link to the page with all the saved recipe (href='/saved-recipes.html').
        - the container encapsulates 2 items "a material icon" & "a Saved Recipes text".
        - the container is a style component called "btn".
        - the container is a style component called "btn-primary".
        - the material icon have an aria-hidden of true.






STEP 2: THE HEADER COMPONENT STYLING

    THE HAS-STATE INTERACTION
        Concept
            - we would encapsulate an interaction into the 'has-state class'.
            - in the Header UI, each nav link & the icon button has this interaction.
            - for the implementation of this interaction we will utilize the 'after pseudo-element' 
            - such that where the element with the 'has-state class' is in hover state or focus-visible state and not active state, its background color will be the variable 'alpha-10'
            - where are we particular about the 'not active state'. 
                - because this class will be placed on the navigation link; 
                - but we want this background color transition to apply to the link that is not currently active

        Implementation
            - the has-state element is given a relative position, hidden overflow
            - the has-state element after pseudo-element is given an empty content, absolute position with zero inset, short transition
            - utilizing the WHERE & NOT PSEUDO-CLASSES; when the has-state element is in 'hover state' or 'focus-visible state' NOT 'active state', the has-state element after pseudo-element background-color will change to 'alpha-10 variable'

        Style Type
            - Reusable


    THE MATERIAL ICON SETTING
        Concept
            - utilizing the material icon cdn, we can use their icon in our html code
            - in the Header UI, we have two of this icons
            - to do so, we encapsulate the icon-name in a span element & give it the 'material-symbols-outlined class'.
            - now we want to style the size, font-variation-settings & display of the icons. we do this using the 'material-symbols-outlined class'

        Implementation
            - display settings to block display, hidden overflow
            - size settings to 1em width, 1em height
            - with knowledge from material icon documentation, font-variation-settings to 0 FILL, 400 wght, 0 GRAD, 24 opsz

        Style Type
            - Reusable


    THE ICON BUTTON STYLE COMPONENT
        Concept
            - an icon button is a button that encapsulate a material icon
            - we have this buttons in several UI of our application. the Header UI has one of this type of button.
            - we want to style all this button in the same way therefore we would utilize the "icon-btn class"
            - we would encapsulate a styling for a button in the "icon-btn class".

        Implementation
            - display settings to grid display, center place-items
            - size settings to 40 pixel width, 40 pixel height
            - color settings to `primary-container` background color
            - box styling to `radius-circle` border radius

        Style Type
            - Component


    THE BUTTON STYLE COMPONENT
        Concept
             - there are buttons spread across our pages and we want to style them in a specific way
             - we encapsulate this styling in the 'btn class'
             - some of this kind of button have icons in them tagged via the 'has-icon class'. DO NOTE THEY ARE DIFFERENT FROM ICON BUTTONS
             - buttons with the 'btn class' & 'has-icon class' has a slightly different box styling setting

        Implementation
            - display settings to flex display, center align-items, center justify-content, 8 pixel gap.
            - size settings to 40 pixel height, max-content max width
            - box settings to radius-4 border radius, 24 pixel inline padding
            - interaction settings to `short transition`
            - box settings of button that has icon ('btn has-icon') to 16 pixel start inline padding

        Style Type
            - Component


    THE PRIMARY BUTTON STYLE COMPONENT
        Concept
            - there are buttons ('btn class') that are regarded as primary buttons basically because of their color setting; they use a primary color of the site
            - we want to style the coloring of this buttons differently therefore, we encapsulate this styling in a 'btn-primary class'

        Implementation
            - color settings to `primary` background color, white text color
            - color setting when in 'hover state' OR 'focus-visible state' does not apply to 'active state' to `primary hover` background color.

        Style Type
            - Component


    THE SECONDARY BUTTON STYLE COMPONENT
        Concept
            - there are buttons ('btn class') that are regarded as primary buttons basically because of their color setting; they use a secondary color
            - we want to style the coloring of this buttons differently therefore, we encapsulate this styling in a 'btn-secondary class'

        Implementation
            - color settings to `primary-container` background color  

        Style Type
            - Component

    
    THE MOBILE HEADER STYLING
        Concept
            - using a mobile first approach, the header by default will be in its mobile form.
            - in mobile, the navbar & primary button in the header will be hidden
            - in mobile, dark theme items in the header WILL HAVE NO DISPLAY when they have an ancestor with the attribute data-theme set to 'light'
            - in mobile, light theme items itn the header WILL HAVE NO DISPLAY when they have an ancestor with the attribute data-theme set to 'dark'
            - the header element is going to be styled via the "header class"

        Implementation
            - display settings to flex display, center align-items, 8 pixel gap
            - position settings to fixed position, 0 top, 0 left, 4 z-index
            - size settings to 100 percent width, `header-height` height
            - color settings to `background variable` background color
            - box settings to 8 pixel padding, 1 pixel solid border with `primary-container` color

        Style Type
            - Header UI






STEP 3: THE HEADER COMPONENT INTERACTION (PAGE THEME LOGIC)

    Concept
        - the theme switch icon is placed in the Header so let's talk about the page theme logic.
        - the `data-theme attribute` of the html element sets the theme of the page.
        - the current theme of the page will be stored in the session storage since this information will be needed by the 4 pages of the web application.
        - the `theme.js script` placed in the `head element` takes care of the theme logic of the page.
        - the theme.js script does three things:
            - sets the `data-theme` based on the theme value in the session storage
            - sets the `data-theme` based on the window prefers-color-scheme IF NO THEME VALUE IN SESSION STORAGE
            - sets a click event handler on the theme switch button
        - the click event handler does three things:
            - set the `aria-pressed attribute` of the button to its complement
            - set the `data-theme attribute` of html to its complement
            - set the `theme key` of the session storage to the `data-theme attribute`

    Implementation
        - inside the theme.js script
        - set the NodeElement variable `HTML` which corresponds to the html element `const /** NodeElement **/ $HTML = document.documentElement`
        - set the boolean variable `isDark` which corresponds to if the window prefers-color-scheme is dark; this is inspected using the window match media function `window.matchmedia("(prefers-color-scheme:dark)").matches`
        - set the data-theme of the html element to the session storage theme value IF SESSION STORAGE HAVE THE ITEM THEME; `$HTML.dataset.theme = sessionStorage.getItem("theme")`
        - set the data-theme of the html element to 'dark' IF isDark IS TRUE OTHERWISE SET TO 'light'
        - add a load event handler to the window element
            - set the NodeElement variable `themeBtn` to the button element `document.querySelector('[data-theme-switch]')
            - add a click event handler on the themeBtn
                - set the boolean variable `ariaPressed` to the ariaPressed attribute of the button element `let /** Boolean **/ $ariaPressed = this.getAttribute("aria-pressed")`
                - set the `aria-pressed attribute` of the button element to the complement of `ariaPressed variable` `this.setAttribute("aria-pressed", !ariaPressed)`
                - set the `data-theme` of the html element to 'light' if the value is 'dark' else set to 'dark' `$HTML.dataset.theme = $HTML.dataset.theme==="dark" ? "light" : "dark"`
                - set the `theme key` of the session Storage `sessionStorage.setItem("theme", $HTML.dataset.theme)`






STEP 4: THE MOBILE NAVIGATION LAYOUT
    
    Concept
        - the navigation is implemented with an unordered list with three list item 'Recipes Link', 'Home Link' & 'Saved Link'
        - the list items are actually links to a page of the web application
        - the list items link contains two things the item-icon & the item-text
        - the item icon is a container that encapsulates a material icon which is centered in it
        - the item-text font size category is label-medium
        - the active list item link has an aria-current of true
        - the navigation container has an aria-label of `primary`
        - the material icon has an aria-hidden of true 
        
    Implementation
        - therefore a 'nav element' encapsulate a 'ul element' which encapsulate '3 li elements'
        - the li elements encapsulate an 'anchor element'. the anchor element encapsulate '2 span elements'
        - the span element for the item-icon & the span element for the item-text
        - the item-icon span element encapsulates the 'material icon span element'.
        - the item-text span element has a 'label-medium class'
        - the nav element has an aria-label of `primary`
        - the material icon span element has an aria-hidden of true.
        - the 'anchor element' that is active has an aria-current of true.



        


STEP 5: THE MOBILE NAVIGATION STYLING

    Specification
        - we want the mobile navigation to be position at the bottom of the screen and be a certain height and viewport width
        - we want the mobile navigation to have a top & bottom padding
        - we want the navigation links to occupy equal width space
        - we want the navigation link content to be centered
        - we want the navigation link icon container to have a grayish background color when the navigation link is hovered upon
        - we want the active navigation icon container to have a different background color
        - we want the active navigation icon container material icon to have a 100 percent FILL

    Concept
        - the nav element via the 'mobile-nav class' specifies the positioning, size, box styling & colouring of the mobile navigation, 
        - the ul element via the 'nav-list class' specifies display; since we want the link to occupy equal width space, we utilize the `1fr concept` in grid display.
        - the ul element via the 'nav-list class' also specify the a center text align
        - the first span element via the 'item-icon class' specifies the box styles of the icon container, using an auto margin-inline for centering.
        - the anchor element via the 'nav-link class', we can check the hover & focus visible state
        - the anchor element via the 'nav-link class', we can check if it has the attribute 'aria-current=true'

    Implementation
        - via the 'mobile-nav class'
        - set the position settings to bottom position, zero left, zero bottom, four z-index.
        - set the size settings to 100 percent width, mobile-nav-height variable as height
        - set the box settings to 12 pixel by 16 pixel block padding, 'shadow-1' box shadow
        - set the color settings to 'primary-container' background color, 'on-background-variant' text color

        - via the 'nav-list' class
        - set the display settings to grid display, 1fr x 3 grid template column
        - set the text settings to center text align

        - via the 'item-icon' class
        - set the size settings to 64pixel width, 32pixel height
        - set the display settings to grid display, center place-items
        - set the box setting to 8pixel border radius, auto margin inline, 4pixel margin bottom
        - set the transition setting to short transition

        - where the 'nav-link' of the 'mobile-nav' is in hover state, focus-visible state, set the 'item-icon' color settings to alpha-10 background color
        - when the 'nav-link' of the 'mobile-nav' have attribute aria-current=true, set the 'item-icon' color settings to active-indicator background color
        - when the 'nav-link' of the 'mobile-nav' have attribute aria-current=true, set the 'material-symbols-outlined class' font variation settings to 'FILL' 1
